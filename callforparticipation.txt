		    ======== IFL 2022 ===========

       The 34th Symposium on Implementation and Application of
			 Functional Languages
		    August 31 - September 2, 2022
		  University of Copenhagen, Denmark
		       https://ifl22.github.io/

The goal of IFL is to bring together researchers and developers
actively engaged in the implementation and application of functional
programming languages and function-oriented programming. IFL 2022 is
held in beautiful Copenhagen, Denmark and is a venue for researchers
to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and
publication-ripe results related to the implementation and application
of functional programming languages and function-oriented programming.

== INVITED SPEAKERS ==

IFL 2022 is pleased to announce keynote talks by the following three
invited speakers:

* Peter Sestoft, Professor, Head of Department, IT University of
  Copenhagen, Denmark: "Abstract machines and functional language
  implementation"

* Lennart Augustsson, Principal Programmer, Epic Games: "Verse - a new
  functional-logic language"

* Thomas Gazagnaire, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder, Tarides:
  "Talk title to be announced"

== VENUE AND REGISTRATION ==

The symposium will be held physically on one of University of
Copenhagen campuses from the 31st of August to the 2nd of September to
provide a stimulating interactive environment for developing,
presenting, exchanging and discussing informal ideas, work in progress
and publication-ripe results. We plan to record and/or stream talks
online as well; physical participation is prioritized and highly
encouraged, however.

For registration and fees, please consult the symposium web site at
https://ifl22.github.io/ . Please notice that the early registration
date is August 15, 2022 (AoE).

== POST-SYMPOSIUM PEER-REVIEW ==

Following IFL tradition, IFL 2022 will use a post-symposium review
process to produce the formal proceedings.

Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft papers
will be screened by the program chair to make sure that they are
within the scope of IFL. The draft papers will be made available to
all participants at the symposium. Each draft paper is presented by
one of the authors at the symposium. Notice that it is a requirement
that draft papers that are accepted for presentation are presented
physically at the symposium.

After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a full paper,
incorporating feedback from discussions at the symposium. Work
submitted to IFL may not be simultaneously submitted to other venues;
submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy. The
program committee will evaluate these submissions according to their
correctness, novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and
clarity, and will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or
rejected for the formal proceedings. Papers that are accepted for the
formal proceedings are published in the International Conference
Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library, as in previous years.

More information about the submission and reviewing process, including
topics of interests is available from the symposium web site.

== PETER LANDIN PRIZE ==

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the
symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program
committee based on the submissions received for the formal review
process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.

== DATES ==

Submission deadline of draft papers   August 8th, 2022 (EXPIRED)
Notification of acceptance            August 9th, 2022 (EXPIRED)
Early registration deadline           August 15th, 2022 (AoE)
Late registration deadline            September 1st, 2022
