      <h2><a href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>

      The goal of IFL is to bring together researchers and developers
      actively engaged in the implementation and application of
      functional programming languages and function-oriented programming. IFL 2022
      will be a venue for researchers to present and discuss new ideas
      and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results
      related to the implementation and application of functional
      programming languages and function-oriented programming.

    <section id="review">
      <h2><a href="#review">Post-symposium peer-review</a></h2>

      <p>
        Following IFL tradition, IFL 2022 will use a post-symposium
        review process to produce the formal proceedings.

      <p>
        Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft
        papers will be screened by the program chair to make sure that
        they are within the scope of IFL. The draft papers will be
        made available to all participants at the symposium. Each
        draft paper is presented by one of the authors at the
        symposium. <em>Notice that it is a requirement that draft
        papers that are accepted for presentation are presented
        physically at the symposium.</em>

      <p>
        After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a
        full paper, incorporating feedback from discussions at the
        symposium. Work submitted to IFL may not be simultaneously
        submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM
        SIGPLAN's republication policy. The program committee will
        evaluate these submissions according to their correctness,
        novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity,
        and will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or
        rejected for the formal proceedings. Papers that are accepted
        for the formal proceedings are published in the International
        Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library, as
        in previous years.

      <p>
        Reviewing is single blind. There will be at least 3 reviews
        per paper. The reviewers have 6 weeks to write their
        reviews. For the camera-ready version the authors can make
        minor revisions which are accepted without further reviewing.

    <section id="peter-landin-prize">
      <h2><a href="#peter-landin-prize">Peter Landin prize</a></h2>

      The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at
      the symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the
      program committee based on the submissions received for the
      formal review process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent
      to 150 Euros.

      <p>
        All contributions must be written in English. Papers must use

      <p>
        Contributions submitted for the draft paper deadline must be
        between two and twelve pages long. For the final proceedings
        twelve pages (excluding references) is the hard upper

      <h2><a href="#venue">Venue</a></h2>

      The symposium will be held physically on one of University of
      Copenhagen campuses from the 31st of August to the 2nd of September to provide a stimulating interactive environment for
      developing, presenting, exchanging and discussing informal
      ideas, work in progress and publication-ripe results. We plan to record and/or stream talks online
      as well; physical participation is prioritized and highly encouraged, however.

      Copenhagen is easy to get to by plane, train and bus.  See <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1zv-GsIvDjb9ZIdRbJUaJRfbLhEgNOGpC&usp=sharing>IFL 2022 map of Copenhagen</a>.  For public transportation within Copenhagen by any combination of train,
      rapid transit (S-tog), metro and bus, download the app "DOT Tickets", register a credit card, and buy a
      2-zone ticket at the start each trip of one hour or less. (For the trip from/to the airport you need a 3-zone ticket.) Alternatively, walk, bike (e.g. via Donkey Republic, Bycyklen, Lime apps) or drive (parking is available at the venue; contact the IFL general chair).

      <p>
      We have not made agreements with specific hotels since Copenhagen
      is densely packed with hotels at various price levels, all
      accessible by convenient and frequent public transport from and to the
      venue.  For example <a href="https://www.wakeupcopenhagen.com/">WakeUp
      Copenhagen</a> features small modern rooms, affordable
      rates and has multiple locations in Copenhagen, including the
      city center and near Copenhagen Airport. See Google, Hotels.com, Booking.com, AirBnB, TripAdvisor, Momondo, etc, for accommodation.
      It is a good idea to check cancelation policies in case of last-minute changes such as COVID-19 measures or flight cancelations.
      <p>
      Denmark presently has no entry or other restrictions due to COVID-19.
      In particular, there are no limitations on sizes of gatherings;
      wearing face masks is welcome, but is not required anywhere.  Health authorities are continuously monitoring Omicron variant infections.
Since these have not led to increased hospitalization (yet), no restrictions have been contemplated (yet).
The IFL 2022 organizers are carefully following the COVID-19 situation.
In the unlikely event of a COVID-19-based imposition of travel or other restrictions in Denmark, IFL 2022 will be held in hybrid format.
In such case, at the time of notification authors of accepted papers will be given the option to present their work remotely.

    lunches, coffee breaks, receptions, social outing, symposium dinner and access to draft proceedings.
    The student discount is made possible by the symposium's industrial sponsors.</dd>

  Instructions: Please click on "Sign up" on the upper left of the
  sign up page.  Choose "Standard" on the first sign-up page unless
  you are a Ph.D., Master's or bachelor's student enrolled at an
  accredited university.  Check the "Are you presenting at the
  conference?" box on the second sign-up page whether or
  not you will actually be presenting at the conference.  You will also
  need to check the "Do you give us permission to record your presentation
  and share the recording?" box.  Symposium dinner and outing (social
  event) are included in the registration fee; so please check the corresponding
  boxes.  If you know already now that you
  cannot attend the social event or the symposium dinner, you can help
  our planning by unchecking the corresponding
  boxes.  (If you change your mind later on we'll do our best to
  accommodate you.)  You will need to fill out "Dietary Restrictions?"
  twice, on the 'Sign Up' page and on the 'Orderer' page that follows it.  If you have no dietary
  restrictions, please write "None". If you know your university's EU
  VAT number, fill it into the CVR field on the 'Orderer'
  page; if not, don't worry about it.  (The VAT number may help your university
  recover Danish VAT included in the registration fee.)    Finally
  check all required boxes in the payment process and pay. You will get a
 registration confirmation and will subsequently get up-to-date
  information about IFL 2022 by email.
