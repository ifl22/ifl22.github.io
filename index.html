      <h2><a href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>

      The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers
      actively engaged in the implementation and application of
      functional and function-based programming languages. IFL 2022
      will be a venue for researchers to present and discuss new ideas
      and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results
      related to the implementation and application of functional
      languages and function-based programming.

    <section id="venue">
      <h2><a href="#venue">Venue</a></h2>

      IFL 2022 will be held physically in Copenhagen, Denmark, from
      the 31st of August to the 2nd of September.  We plan to record
      and/or stream talks online as well.

      We have made no agreement with specific hotels, but Copenhagen
      is densely packed with hotels at various price levels, all
      accessible with walking or public transport from the venue.  One
      such hotel is <a href="https://www.wakeupcopenhagen.com/">WakeUp
      Copenhagen</a>, located smack in the middle of downtown
      Copenhagen, which is a modern, clean hotel with small rooms.

      <h2><a href="#review">Post-symposium peer-review</a></h2>

      <p>
        Following IFL tradition, IFL 2022 will use a post-symposium
        review process to produce the formal proceedings.

      <p>
        Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft
        papers will be screened by the program chair to make sure that
        they are within the scope of IFL. The draft papers will be made
        available to all participants at the symposium. Each draft paper
        is presented by one of the authors at the symposium.

      <p>
        After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a
        full paper, incorporating feedback from discussions at the
        symposium. Work submitted to IFL may not be simultaneously
        submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM
        SIGPLAN's republication policy. The program committee will
        evaluate these submissions according to their correctness,
        novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity,
        and will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or
        rejected for the formal proceedings. We plan to publish these
        proceedings in the International Conference Proceedings Series
        of the ACM Digital Library, as in previous years.

      <p>
        Reviewing is single blind. There will be at least 3 reviews
        per paper. The reviewers have 6 weeks to write their
        reviews. For the camera-ready version the authors can make
        minor revisions which are accepted without further reviewing.

      <h2><a href="#peter-landin-prize">Peter Landin prize</a></h2>

      The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at
      the symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the
      program committee based on the submissions received for the
      formal review process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent
      to 150 Euros.

      <h2><a href="#submission">Submission details</a></h2>

      <p>
        All contributions must be written in English. Papers must use
        the ACM two columns conference format, which can be found
        <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>. (For <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
        users, start your document with
        <code>\documentclass[format=sigconf]{acmart}</code>.) Note that
        this format has a rather long but limited list of packages that
        can be used. Please make sure that your document adheres to this
        list.

      <p>
        Contributions submitted for the draft paper deadline must be
        between two and twelve pages long. For the final proceedings
        twelve pages (excluding references) is the hard upper
        limit. Especially application papers might be considerably
        shorter.

        Submission link TBA.
